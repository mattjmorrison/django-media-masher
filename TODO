1. Template tag that accepts list of files and returns the hashed name
    a. Template tag must create file if it doesn't exist, or always when development
    b. should depend on Django 1.3's static media finders - maybe?

2. utility to take list of forms and/or formsets (and/or widgets?) and mash media from all
    a. should allow multiple lists to be passed so multiple different files can
        be generated

3. get current process id and add to hashed name so threads don't step on eachother

4. add pre-generate option for template tags (which won't happen until page load time)

5. support for gzip
