1. support for gzip
    a. not sure how to go about doing this yet...(for all browser
            support)

2. make optimizations always lazy when debug is True (manage.py is slow when not lazy)
    a. change __init__ to instead of calling site.mash call
        some method instead... like pre_mash
        - also maybe make site a keyword argument defaulted to
          global site
        - pre_mash needs to do exactly what calling site.mash does, unless DEBUG=True
            - when DEBUG is True it needs to not do anything
                    - if pre_mash returns something, it needs to be some kind of
                      proxy that will be evaluated at request time but not before
